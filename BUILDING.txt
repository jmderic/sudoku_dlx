emacs build line with detail:
make -k VERBOSE=1

Default production build:
BUILD_DIR=sudoku_dlx_build_`date '+%Y%m%d_%H%M%S'`; cd ..; mkdir $BUILD_DIR; cd $BUILD_DIR; cmake ../sudoku_dlx

Debug build:
BUILD_DIR=sudoku_dlx_build_`date '+%Y%m%d_%H%M%S'`; cd ..; mkdir $BUILD_DIR; cd $BUILD_DIR; cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../sudoku_dlx

Note on ASAN:

There is now an asan_support.hpp header which conditionally defines
ATTRIBUTE_NO_SANITIZE_ADDRESS.

Used in other projects, not this one, yet.

This was used in CodeDup_Filter.hpp but, with this commit, the use was
expunged.  But replaced with a use in CodeDup_FileLine.cpp.

The resulting thinking is that asan_support.hpp should only be used in
compilation units, not headers.

Jury still out, but this seem to be a best practice.

Change to separate ASAN from LSAN w/cmake (all invoke with -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug):
Build with AdddressSanitizer only:
BUILD_DIR=sudoku_dlx_build_`date '+%Y%m%d_%H%M%S'`; cd ..; mkdir $BUILD_DIR; cd $BUILD_DIR; cmake -DASAN_ENABLED=ON ../sudoku_dlx
Build with LeakSanitizer only:
BUILD_DIR=sudoku_dlx_build_`date '+%Y%m%d_%H%M%S'`; cd ..; mkdir $BUILD_DIR; cd $BUILD_DIR; cmake -DLSAN_ENABLED=ON ../sudoku_dlx
Both ENABLED flags for both:
BUILD_DIR=sudoku_dlx_build_`date '+%Y%m%d_%H%M%S'`; cd ..; mkdir $BUILD_DIR; cd $BUILD_DIR; cmake -DASAN_ENABLED=ON -DLSAN_ENABLED=ON ../sudoku_dlx

Saw this for building in the source tree per
git@gitlab.com:eidheim/Simple-Web-Server.git

cmake -H. -Bbuild
cmake --build build

Apparently per
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31090821/what-does-the-h-option-means-for-cmake

The Hitchhiker's Guide to the CMake explains both, the legacy and new in CMake 3.13 options:
-H
This internal option is not documented but widely used by community.
