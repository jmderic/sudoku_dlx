Summary
-------

Implements Knuth's
["Dancing Links" Algorithm X](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~jchu/publicportal/sudoku/0011047.pdf)
to solve the "exact cover" problem.  This DLX algorithm was originally
implemented here as a shared library; the shared library version is
tagged as `shared_lib`.  Now it is a C++ header-only library wholly
within `./include/jmdlx.h`.  A couple supporting files give the Sudoku
Solver use case which demonstrates the DLX API.  Unit tests are
implemented in the `test` directory.

The whole thing is pretty short. I like to write code a lot; but I
don't like to write a lot of code!

```
 $ find . \( -name "*.cpp" -o -name "*.h" \) -type f | xargs wc -l
  110 ./test/SudokuDlxTest.cpp
  175 ./src/sudoku_squares.h
   91 ./src/sudoku_main.cpp
  258 ./include/jmdlx.h
  634 total
```

These sizes are likely to change as I'm currently working to update
this code to the C++17 standard as well as to improve it with what
I've learned since the earlier work.

Building and Testing
--------------------

This project builds using `cmake`, recently changed from GNU
autotools.  For more information on building for production, debug,
and building with ASAN and LSAN see
[Building and Testing](BUILDnTEST.md).  This also includes information
on running the unit tests.

Running the Product
-------------------

To run the program in place where you built it, use the executable in
the src directory by typing `./src/sudoku_dlx` from this directory.

After the program name, Enter each of the known squares as a 3 digit
argument representing number, row, and column.  For example, 312 says
a 3 is in row 1, column 2; 474, a 4 in row 7 column 4.

An example run:

```
$ ./src/sudoku_dlx 312 914 715 822 626 528 136 142 543 747 649 351 752 858 559 961 663 167 268 474 282 784 688 895 996 798
